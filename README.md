### Project snapshot

- Title: Nike Elite - Premium Footwear Store (static prototype)
- Primary files: `index.html`, `css/style.css` and assets in `icons/` and `images/`.
- Purpose: A visually-rich marketing and product browsing front-end built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components for rapid prototyping.

### Key features

- Responsive hero carousel with call-to-action.
- Product gallery sections (Casual, Formal) with client-side filters (price, color).
- Clean, component-driven UI using DaisyUI (Tailwind plugin) styles and utility classes.
- Theme switcher (persists selection via localStorage) with multiple DaisyUI themes.
- Reusable card components, hover interactions and CSS animations for a polished feel.
- Accessible HTML semantics and form scaffolding for contact submissions.

### Tech & dependencies

- HTML5 + vanilla JavaScript (no build step required)
- Tailwind CSS (CDN) + DaisyUI (CDN)
- Font Awesome (icons via kit)
- Small custom stylesheet: `css/style.css`

Notes: This project intentionally uses CDN-delivered Tailwind and DaisyUI for simplicity. For production use, consider installing Tailwind via npm and building a minimized CSS bundle.

### Project structure

- `index.html` — main single-page prototype with all sections and demo scripts
- `css/style.css` — small custom styles and animations
- `icons/` — project icons (logo, home, etc.)
- `images/` — product and banner images (mix of local and external URLs)
- `README.md` — this file

### Local setup

This is a static site with no build step. To preview locally:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Serve the folder to mimic a web server (recommended):

### Customization guide

- To change theme options, edit the theme list in `index.html`'s theme switcher.
- Replace example images in `images/` with product photography and update `alt` text for better SEO and accessibility.
- To add or remove products, copy the existing `.card` markup in the product grid and update `data-price` and `data-color` attributes — the client-side filter script uses those.
- For a production Tailwind workflow:
  - Install Tailwind locally (npm), create a `tailwind.config.js`, and import only required utilities.
  - Remove CDN script tag and build a production CSS bundle (minified).

### Accessibility & performance notes

- Images: Several hero/product images are loaded from external sources. Replace external URLs with optimized local assets and generate multiple sizes (srcset) for responsive images.
- Forms: Contact form is static — wire it to a backend endpoint or use a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) for submissions.
- Contrast & semantics: Headings, buttons and form controls use semantic HTML; run Lighthouse or Axe-core for accessibility audits before production.
- Performance: Convert heavy images to WebP, enable caching, and serve assets via a CDN for best results.

### Deployment suggestions

- GitHub Pages: push this repository and enable Pages from the `main` branch (root folder). No build step required if you keep CDN dependencies.
- Static hosts: Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting will work. For optimal performance, build a production Tailwind bundle first.

### Contributing

If you want to extend this prototype into a full storefront:

- Convert to a React/Vue/Next/Remix app and integrate a backend or headless commerce provider (e.g., Shopify, Snipcart, Commerce.js).
- Add unit/integration tests and CI (GitHub Actions) for deploy previews.
- Replace CDN assets with a local build pipeline and enable PurgeCSS (or Tailwind's content scanning) to remove unused utilities.

If you open a pull request, please include a short description of your change and ensure visual regressions are reviewed.

Thank you for checking out Nike Elite — if you'd like, I can also:

- Add a production-ready Tailwind build (npm + postcss) and a minimized CSS pipeline.
- Convert this static prototype to a React app (CRA/Vite/Next) with reusable components and sample state management.

Tell me which follow-up you'd prefer and I'll implement it.
